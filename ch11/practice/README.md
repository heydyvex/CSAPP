#### Practice

1 - Implement a simple TCP client and server program in C.

2 - a UDP client and server program that can send and receive datagrams.

3 - a multi-threaded TCP sever that can handle multiple clients concurrently(in C will be pain in the ass but it is worth it I guess, make as simple as possible, going with Golang is cheating).

4 - a simple HTTP web server that can serve static HTML files.

5 - a TCP and UDP file transfer application that can send a receive files over the network(adding compression also make it more fun)

6 - a program that can perform DNS lookups and resolve hostnames to IP addresses.

7 - a chat application using sockets, where multiple clients can connect and exchange messages like Telnet, for example like this: [smallchat by antirez](https://github.com/antirez/smallchat)

8 - Implement a simple network packet sniffer or analyzer using raw sockets.
