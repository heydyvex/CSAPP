#### Practice

1 - **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Implement a producer-consumer problem using threads or processes. The producer generates data, and the consumer consumes the data. Synchronize the access to the shared buffer using locks or semaphores.

2 - **Parallel File Processing**: a program that reads a large file, splits it into multiple chunks, and processes each chunk in parallel using threads or processes. Merge the results after all chunks are processed.

3 - **Web Crawler**: Implement a multi-threaded or multi-process web crawler that fetches pages from multiple URLs concurrently.

4 - **Matrix Multiplication**: a program that multiplies two matrices in parallel using threads or processes. Divide the matrices into smaller blocks and distribute the computations across multiple threads or processes.

5 - **Parallel Sort**: Implement a parallel sorting algorithm, such as parallel merge sort or parallel quicksort, using threads or processes.

6 - **Reader-Writer Problem**: Implement the reader-writer problem, where multiple readers can access a shared resource concurrently, but writers must have exclusive access.

7 - **Barrier Synchronization**: a program that simulates a group of threads or processes that must wait for each other at certain points of execution (barriers).

8 - **Parallel Image Processing**: a program that applies filters or transformations to an image in parallel using threads or processes.

9 - **Concurrent Data Structures**: Implement thread-safe versions of common data structures, such as queues, stacks, or hash tables, using locks or other synchronization mechanisms.
