#### Practice for this chapter

Hardware Level
- Implement a simple CPU simulator that can handle various types of exceptions, such as division by zero, invalid memory access and overflow conditions 
- write a program that generates those hardware exceptions(named above) and observe how the simulator handles them

Operating System Level:
- Implement a simple operating system kernel module that handles exceptions like page faults, system calls and interrupts
- write a use-space program that intentionally generates different types of exceptions (segmentation fault, illegal instruction) and see how kernel module reacts
- implement a signal handler in a program that catches and handles specific signals sent by the operating system

Process Level:
- write a multi-threaded program that uses exception or signals for inter-thread communication or synchronization 
- implement a simple exception handling mechanism for a custom data structure or algorithm, where exceptions are thrown and caught to handle specific error conditions
- create a program that simulates process creation, context switching, and exception handling by implementing a simple process scheduler and exception handlers

System Call:
- write a program that uses various system calls(like open, read, write) and handles potential exception or errors returned by these system calls
- implement a system call wrapper or library that provides a higher level interface for system calls and handles exceptions or error conditions transparently

Debugging and Analysis:
- Use a debugger or profiling too to analyze the behavior of a program when it encounters exceptions or signals and observe the call stack, register values, and memory state
- analyze the exception handling mechanisms and data structures used by an existing operating system kernel or library by examining its source code or documentation
