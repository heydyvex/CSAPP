notes and Homework practice for Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

[Chapter 1](/ch01/) : A Tour of Computer Systems  
[Chapter 2](/ch02/) : Representing and Manipulating Information  
[Chapter 3](/ch03/) : Machine-Level Representation of Programs  
[Chapter 4](/ch04/) : Processor Architecture  
[Chapter 5](/ch05/) : Optimizing Program Performance (it is incomplete because I think it is necessary to read new book on this subject)  
[Chapter 6](/ch06/) : The Memory Hierarchy  
[Chapter 7](/ch07/) : Linking  
[Chapter 8](/ch08/) : Exceptional Control Flow  
[Chapter 9](/ch09/) : Virtual Memory  
[Chapter 10](/ch10/) : System-Level I/O  
[Chapter 11](/ch11/) : Network Programming  
[Chapter 12](/ch12/) : Concurrent Programming  

note: Homework practices are different from what there are in book.

--- 
Few words 
Also one needs to seek good explanations(David Deutsch's principle) in order to understand it. 
Eventually one needs to write a small version of that systems in order to understand.   
If one cannot understand a subject, theory or system etc..., problem could be the teacher or documentation, or problem could be the wrong questions, sometimes you need to look for what problem something solves instead of definition of that something.  

seek good explanations like turing computation theory, Deutsch's universal quantum computer and shannon's information theory.  
try to implement from scratch:  
a tiny processor architecture   
a tiny OS kernel  
a tiny OS file system  
a tiny compiler(semantic analysis, to assembly, assembler, linking)  
a tiny network program  
a tiny web server  
a tiny concurrent program (with the help of kernel functions)  
a tiny massive parallel program using Cuda(a very bad abstraction) on a Nvidia GPU
