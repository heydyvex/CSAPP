# Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information

## Notes

Binary digits(bits) are used in computers and representing data, because it is easy to do, high or low voltage, turn on or turn off, Up or down etc...

Instead of single bit block for memory, 1 byte(8 bits) is used for 1 block in memory and byte is the smallest unit of memory that is assessable.

A single byte is 8 bit from 00000000 to 11111111, decimal equivalence is from 0 to 255.
Mathematician thought **Hexadecimal** would be better to describing bit patterns, Hexadecimal(hex) is base 16, from 0 to 9 and from A to F.

| Hexadecimal | Decimal | Binary |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0           | 0       | 0000   |
| 1           | 1       | 0001   |
| 2           | 2       | 0010   |
| 3           | 3       | 0011   |
| 4           | 4       | 0100   |
| 5           | 5       | 0101   |
| 6           | 6       | 0110   |
| 7           | 7       | 0111   |
| 8           | 8       | 1000   |
| 9           | 9       | 1001   |
| A           | 10      | 1010   |
| B           | 11      | 1011   |
| C           | 12      | 1100   |
| D           | 13      | 1101   |
| E           | 14      | 1110   |
| F           | 15      | 1111   |
