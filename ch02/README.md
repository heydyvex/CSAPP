# Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information

## Notes

Authors made a mistake at the beginning of this chapter: *The familiar decimal, or base-10, representation has been in use for over 1,000 years, having been developed in India, improved by ~~Arab~~ mathematicians in the 12th century*.
this is obviously wrong, Khwarizmi was **Persian**, not Arab. Persia(Iran) was invaded by Arabs Muslims, it doesnâ€™t mean Iranian intellectuals are Arab.

Binary digits(bits) are used in computers and representing data, because it is easy to do, high or low voltage, turn on or turn off, Up or down etc...
