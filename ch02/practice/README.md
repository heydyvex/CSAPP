[show_bytes.c](show_bytes.c) : program that shows bytes of data types in C stored in memory (to see byte representation of data in memory)

tasks to do:

- a program that check if machine use little endian to store data or bid endian.
- a program that reverse the bits in an integer, Count the number of 1's in the binary representation of a number.
- a program that perform bitwise operations.
