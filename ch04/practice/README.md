Tasks in order to practice chip design and understand it:

- Implement a simple combinational logic circuit, such as a half-adder or a full-adder circuit, using logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, blah blah). you'll understand the concept of combinational logic.

- Implement a simple sequential logic circuit, such as a binary counter or a finite state machine. you'll understand the concept of sequential logic, where the output depends not only on the current inputs but also on the previous state(s) of the circuit. (Understanding flip-flops, registers, and state transitions is crucial for this task).

- Design a simple processor capable of executing a small instruction set. This could involve designing a basic arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a control unit, and a register file. This will help understand the fundamental components of a processor and how they work together to execute instructions.

- Design a simple memory system, such as a random access memory (RAM) or a read-only memory (ROM). This will introduce the concepts of memory addressing, data storage, and memory organization.

- also play with FPGA and implement all above tasks.
