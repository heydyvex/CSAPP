Tasks in order to practice chip design and understand it:

1 - Design a simple combinational logic circuit, Task: Design and implement a simple combinational logic circuit, such as a half-adder or a full-adder circuit, using logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, blah blah). This will introduce the concept of combinational logic and help understand how basic arithmetic operations can be implemented using logic gates.

2 - Design a simple sequential logic circuit, Task: Design and implement a simple sequential logic circuit, such as a binary counter or a finite state machine. This will introduce the concept of sequential logic, where the output depends not only on the current inputs but also on the previous state(s) of the circuit. Understanding flip-flops, registers, and state transitions is crucial for this task.

3 - Design a simple processor, Task: Design a simple processor capable of executing a small instruction set. This could involve designing a basic arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a control unit, and a register file. This task will help understand the fundamental components of a processor and how they work together to execute instructions.

4 - Design a simple memory system, Task: Design a simple memory system, such as a random access memory (RAM) or a read-only memory (ROM). This will introduce the concepts of memory addressing, data storage, and memory organization.

5 - Implement the designs on an FPGA or using a hardware description language (HDL), Task: Implement the previously designed circuits (combinational logic, sequential logic, simple processor, and memory system) on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or using a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL. This step will provide hands-on experience in translating circuit designs into real hardware implementations and working with hardware description languages and FPGA development tools.
