Book's homework and problems are horrible for chapter 3, I asked Claude.ai to give me some task to do in order to learn assembly

ToDo list:

1 - Write a C program that declares different data types (int, float, double, char, etc.) and print their values in hexadecimal format. Then, examine the corresponding assembly code generated by the compiler to understand how these data types are represented at the machine level.
Experiment with different data type sizes (e.g., short, int, long) and observe how the assembly code changes to handle the different sizes.

2 - Write a simple C function that takes arguments and returns a value. Examine the assembly code generated for the function call and return, paying attention to how arguments are passed and how the return value is handled.
Experiment with different calling conventions (e.g., `__cdecl`, `__stdcall`) and observe the differences in the assembly code.

3 - Write a C program that includes various control flow statements (if-else, switch, loops). Examine the generated assembly code to understand how these constructs are implemented at the machine level.
Experiment with different branch conditions and observe how the assembly code handles conditional jumps.

4 - Write a C program that dynamically allocates and deallocates memory using `malloc` and `free`. Examine the assembly code generated for these operations to understand how memory is managed at the low level.
Experiment with different memory allocation sizes and observe how the assembly code handles different allocation sizes.

5 - try writing some simple assembly instructions directly in your C code and observe how they interact with the surrounding C code.
Experiment with different assembly instructions (e.g., arithmetic, logical, data movement) and observe their effects.

6 - Write a simple C function and compile it with different optimization levels (-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3). Examine the generated assembly code to understand how the compiler optimizes the code at different levels.
Experiment with different algorithms or data structures and observe how the assembly code changes with different optimizations.

7 - Obtain a simple executable file (e.g., a small utility program) and disassemble it using a tool like `objdump` or `gdb`. Analyze the assembly code to understand how the program works at the machine level.
Try modifying the assembly code and reassembling it to observe the effects on the program's behavior.
