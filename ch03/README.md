# Chapter 3: Machine-Level Representation of Programs


## Notes

Okay, this chapter going to be about machine-level representation on program, assembly and compilers, It's going to be fun I guess, different level of abstraction, from C to assembly to machine code, how arrays and structures like this data types are implemented in machine level ... seems fun.
