Book's homework and problems are horrible for chapter 3, I asked Claude.ai to give me some task to do in order to learn assembly

ToDo list:

- a program that declares different data types (int, float, double, char, etc.) and print their values in hexadecimal format. Then, look at the corresponding assembly code generated by the compiler to understand how these data types are represented at the machine level.

- a function that takes arguments and returns a value. look at the assembly code generated for the function call and return.

- a program that includes various control flow statements (if-else, switch, loops). look at the generated assembly code to understand how these constructs are implemented at the machine level.

- a program that dynamically allocates and deallocates memory using `malloc` and `free`. look at the assembly code generated for these operations, see how memory is managed at the low level.

- try writing some simple assembly instructions directly in your C code and observe how they interact with the surrounding C code.

- a function and compile it with different optimization levels (-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3). look at the generated assembly code and how the compiler optimizes the code at different levels.

- Obtain a simple executable file (e.g., a small utility program) and disassemble it using a tool like `objdump` or `gdb`. Analyze the assembly code to understand how the program works at the machine level.

- Implement Game of Life cellular automaton 

- write a simple operating system Kernel 

- building a bootloader? seems very very fun to do.
