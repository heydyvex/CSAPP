#### Practice

1 - a program that read a file line by line and prints each line to the console.

2 - a program that takes a string as input from the user and writes it to a new file.

3 - a program that copies the contents of one file to another.

4 - a program that reads data from standard input(keyboard) until the user enters a specific character (like 'w') and then writes the input to a file.

5 - a program that opens a file, seeks to a specific position, reads a specified number of bytes, prints the read data to console.

6 - a program that uses the `fork()` system call to create a child process, and the child process reads from a file while the parent process writes to the same file.

7 - a program that creates a named pipe (`mkfifo`) and uses it to communicate between two processes, where one process writes data to the pipe, and the other process reads from the pipe.

8 - a program that uses the `select()` or `poll()` system call to monitor multiple file descriptors (e.g., standard input, a file, and a socket) for input/output events.

9 - a program that opens a network socket, binds it to a specific IP address and port, and listens for incoming connections. When a connection is accepted, read data from the socket and print it to the console.

10 - a program that uses the `mmap()` system call to memory-map a file and then read or modify the file's contents directly in memory.
